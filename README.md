# Better Local Chat

 - No more ugly message prefixes!
 - `LOCAL` messages show in Global too!
 - `/l` command to chat from `GLOBAL` without changing tabs!

 While chatting in `LOCAL` you can now prefix any message with a new `/l` command in order to send it as a `LOCAL` message.
 (Although I don't imagine it will happen often you _can_ also combine `/l /me emotes` and chain these commands to emote in `LOCAL`. `/l` works the very same way that your `/me` emotes do.)

 Additionally, `LOCAL` messages are _also_ shown under the `GLOBAL` tab with a clean and simple message prefix
 for distinction. This way, you don't have to choose missing out on `GLOBAL` messages while having a `LOCAL` conversation. Now you can have both.

 The glitchy-looking text cramping up everyone's messages in the `LOCAL` tab is patched and removed, too.
